# Anothe RPI5 project with AI
Raspberry Pi 5 16GB with AI hat for network security monitor 
Goal: To create a comprehensive resource for setting up, configuring, tuning, and potentially applying AI/ML to a home network security monitoring system based on a Raspberry Pi 5, Arkime, Suricata, and an AI accelerator.

Project Title: RPi5 Home Network Security Monitor & AI Analysis

Overview: Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB, NVMe, AI Hat) with Arkime and Suricata for comprehensive home network traffic analysis and threat detection. Leverages CRISP-DM for a structured approach to potentially applying ML/AI for anomaly detection.

Motivation: Enhance personal network security posture (Vantaa, Finland home network), gain deeper insights into network traffic, experiment with edge AI for security applications.

Hardware Stack:

Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM, 1TB NVMe, PoE, Cooling)

AI Hat: [Specify your exact AI Hat model here - e.g., Raspberry Pi AI Kit (Hailo-8L)]

Unifi Switch: [Your Model, e.g., USW-Flex-Mini] (Port Mirroring enabled)

Network Interface: Built-in Ethernet + [Your USB Ethernet Adapter Model, if used] for capture.

Software Stack:

OS: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit Bookworm recommended)

Core: Suricata, Arkime, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch

AI: [Python, Libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite, Specific AI Hat SDKs]

Other: Docker (Optional), Git, SSH

Methodology: CRISP-DM (see docs/ and notebooks/ for phase details).

Project Structure: Briefly explain the directory layout.

Current Status: See latest entry in DIARY.md.

Getting Started: Link to docs/00_Setup_Hardware_OS.md and subsequent setup guides.

DIARY.md (Chronological - Newest First Recommended)

(YYYY-MM-DD): Log Entry Title: Description of work done, challenges faced, decisions made, links to relevant files/notebooks updated. Example: Configured Unifi port mirroring, updated docs/02_Setup_Traffic_Capture.md.

(YYYY-MM-DD): CRISP-DM Modeling (CPU): Developed initial anomaly detection model. See notebooks/04a_Modeling_CPU_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb. Next step: evaluate resource usage.

(YYYY-MM-DD): Setup Issue: Encountered problem X while installing Arkime. Resolved by doing Y. Updated docs/01_Setup_Core_Software.md.

(YYYY-MM-DD): Project Init: Created repository structure based on template. Defined initial goals in docs/CRISP-DM_Phase_1_Business_Understanding.md.

Other Directories:

config/: Store example versions of your configuration files. Remove any sensitive information (passwords, specific IPs if necessary). This helps others understand the setup.

docs/: Contains detailed Markdown guides for setup and text-based CRISP-DM phases. Break down complex setup procedures into logical files.

notebooks/: The core of the "pipeline" and "cells" approach for data work. Use Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) here. Each notebook should focus on a specific task (e.g., data cleaning, feature engineering, model training). Use Markdown cells within notebooks extensively to explain the code and reasoning.

scripts/: For standalone scripts that automate tasks (installation, running inference, data fetching). Keep them well-commented.

data/: Generally, avoid committing large data files or logs. Use this maybe for tiny example files or data schemas. Use the .gitignore file effectively.

src/: If your Python code becomes complex (e.g., custom classes for feature extraction or modeling), organize it into modules here for better reusability and import into notebooks/scripts.

.gitignore: Essential for keeping the repository clean. Include patterns for virtual environments, logs, credentials, OS-specific files, and large data files.

LICENSE: Choose an open-source license (MIT or Apache 2.0 are common choices) to define how others can use your code/documentation.

This structure provides a solid foundation for your project, combining methodical documentation and development practices. You can adapt it as the project evolves.

# Another RPI5 project with AI

GitHub Project Structure: RPi5 Network Security Monitor & AI AnalysisThis document outlines a proposed structure for your GitHub repository, designed to be clear, reproducible, and aligned with the CRISP-DM methodology. It incorporates the diary method for tracking progress and utilizes notebooks for code-based tasks, facilitating easier troubleshooting and collaboration.Inspired By:rrwiren/ilmanlaatu-ennuste-helsinki: CRISP-DM structure, pipeline/notebook approach.rrwiren/rpi5-ai-setup: Clarity, diary/log method.Goal: To create a comprehensive resource for setting up, configuring, tuning, and potentially applying AI/ML to a home network security monitoring system based on a Raspberry Pi 5, Arkime, Suricata, and an AI accelerator.Proposed Directory Structure:rpi5-network-security-monitor/

Key File Content Outlines:README.mdProject Title: RPi5 Home Network Security Monitor & AI AnalysisOverview: Utilizing a Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB, NVMe, AI Hat) with Arkime and Suricata for comprehensive home network traffic analysis and threat detection. Leverages CRISP-DM for a structured approach to potentially applying ML/AI for anomaly detection.Motivation: Enhance personal network security posture (Vantaa, Finland home network), gain deeper insights into network traffic, experiment with edge AI for security applications.Hardware Stack:Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB RAM, 1TB NVMe, PoE, Cooling)AI Hat: [Specify your exact AI Hat model here - e.g., Raspberry Pi AI Kit (Hailo-8L)]Unifi Switch: [Your Model, e.g., USW-Flex-Mini] (Port Mirroring enabled)Network Interface: Built-in Ethernet + [Your USB Ethernet Adapter Model, if used] for capture.Software Stack:OS: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit Bookworm recommended)Core: Suricata, Arkime, Elasticsearch/OpenSearchAI: [Python, Libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Lite, Specific AI Hat SDKs]Other: Docker (Optional), Git, SSHMethodology: CRISP-DM (see docs/ and notebooks/ for phase details).Project Structure: Briefly explain the directory layout (referencing the structure above).Current Status: See latest entry in DIARY.md.Getting Started: Link to docs/00_Setup_Hardware_OS.md and subsequent setup guides.DIARY.md (Chronological - Newest First Recommended)(YYYY-MM-DD): Log Entry Title: Description of work done, challenges faced, decisions made, links to relevant files/notebooks updated. Example: Configured Unifi port mirroring, updated docs/02_Setup_Traffic_Capture.md.(YYYY-MM-DD): CRISP-DM Modeling (CPU): Developed initial anomaly detection model. See notebooks/04a_Modeling_CPU_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb. Next step: evaluate resource usage.(YYYY-MM-DD): Setup Issue: Encountered problem X while installing Arkime. Resolved by doing Y. Updated docs/01_Setup_Core_Software.md.(YYYY-MM-DD): Project Init: Created repository structure based on template. Defined initial goals in docs/CRISP-DM_Phase_1_Business_Understanding.md.Other Directories:config/: Store example versions of your configuration files. Remove any sensitive information (passwords, specific IPs if necessary). This helps others understand the setup.docs/: Contains detailed Markdown guides for setup and text-based CRISP-DM phases. Break down complex setup procedures into logical files. Include observations, decisions, and rationale.notebooks/: The core of the "pipeline" and "cells" approach for data work. Use Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) here. Each notebook should focus on a specific task (e.g., data cleaning, feature engineering, model training). Use Markdown cells within notebooks extensively to explain the code and reasoning.scripts/: For standalone scripts that automate tasks (installation, running inference, data fetching). Keep them well-commented.data/: Generally, avoid committing large data files or logs. Use this maybe for tiny example files or data schemas. Use the .gitignore file effectively.src/: If your Python code becomes complex (e.g., custom classes for feature extraction or modeling), organize it into modules here for better reusability and import into notebooks/scripts..gitignore: Essential for keeping the repository clean. Include patterns for virtual environments, logs, credentials, OS-specific files, and large data files.LICENSE: Choose an open-source license (MIT or Apache 2.0 are common choices) to define how others can use your code/documentation.This structure, especially with the directory tree enclosed in ```, should render much better in your GitHub README.md.
